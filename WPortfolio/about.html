            <h2>About Our Company</h2>
            <p class="highlighted-text">I’m Heemanshu Kumar, a passionate Software Developer and Broadcasting Engineer with a strong foundation in Java, Spring Boot, and Frontend Development. I enjoy building scalable applications, intuitive user interfaces, and clean, efficient code that solve real-world problems.

                With experience in both technical problem-solving and creative design, I bring a balanced approach to projects—whether it’s developing REST APIs, designing responsive websites, or working with databases like MongoDB.

                I am continuously expanding my skills in DSA, web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React), and modern backend frameworks, while also keeping an eye on emerging technologies. My goal is to create digital solutions that are not only functional but also user-friendly and impactful.</p>
